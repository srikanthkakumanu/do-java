/**
 * The builder pattern is another creational pattern for creating more complex data structures
 * by separating the construction from the representation itself.
 *
 * It solves various object creation problems, like multistep creation and validation,
 * and improves non-mandatory argument handling.
 *
 * Therefore, itâ€™s a good companion for Records, which can only be created in a single swoop.
