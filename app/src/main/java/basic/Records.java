/**
 * Record:
 * Record purpose is to carry just the data and no boilerplate code is required.
 * It is commonly referred to as an aggregate type.
 * Records are immutable data classes that require only the type and field names.
 * No setXXX() are generated because all records are immutable. However, if a record holds a reference
 * to some object, you can make a change to that object, but you cannot change to what object the
 * reference in the record refers. Thus, in Java terms, records are said to be shallowly immutable.
 * <p>
 * Once Record is declared - equals(), toString(), hashCode() methods, private and 
 * final fields, public constructor (with fields defined at record declaration level)
 * are generated by compiler.
 * <p>
 * 1. By default, All record declarations implicitly inherits from Record. 
 *      So, no more extends are allowed as Java does not support multiple inheritance.
 * <p>
 * 2. By default, all records create a canonical constructor with the arguments 
 *      that are defined at declaration level. But we can override that canonical constructor.
 * <p>
 * 3. We can override the default constructor with Compact constructor as shown below.
 *      This is special to records only and useful to override constructors in more compact way.
 * <p>
 * 4. We can define multiple constructors with different combinations of arguments.
 * <p>
 * 5. It can implement interfaces.
 * <p>
 * 6. By default, All records are final hence it cannot be extended further.
 * <p>
 * 7. Once declared, all the record fields are immutable hence cannot be changed. 
 *      Hence, they are thread-safe and thereby no synchronization is required.
 * <p>
 * 8. It allows only static constants to be declared. no instance level fields (non-static) are allowed. 
 *      Any fields are needed, they should be declared as arguments at record declaration level.
 * <p>
 * 9. A record can be generic i.e. it supports generic just like any other types.
 *      However, A constructor cannot be generic, and it cannot include a throws
 *      clause either at constructor or getter method level.
