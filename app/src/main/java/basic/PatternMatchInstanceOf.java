/**
 * In Java 14, an improved version of instanceof is introduced i.e. Pattern matching
 * as an experimental feature and became permanent feature from Java 16.
 * <p>
 * Traditional instanceof approach:
 * 1. For each conditional block, we are testing the animal parameter
 *      to determine its type, convert it via a cast and declaring a
 *      local variable. Then we can perform operations specific to
 *      that particular animal.
 * 2. Drawbacks:
 *  - need to test the type and make a cast for every conditional block
 *  - repeat the type name three times for every if block.
 *  - Readability is poor
 *  - problem magnifies each time we add a new animal.
 * <p>
 * Pattern Matching for instanceof:
 * 1. It is a mechanism that determines if a value fits a general form. Pattern
 *      matching is used to test the type of value. A type must be a reference type.
 * <p>
 * 2. This kind of pattern is called a type pattern. If the pattern matches,
 *      a pattern variable will receive a reference to the object matched by
 *      the pattern.
 * <p>
 * 3. If instanceof succeeds, pattern variable will be created and contain a reference
 *      to the object that matches the pattern. If it fails, pattern variable
 *      is never created.
